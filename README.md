# Why I chose MIT License
The MIT license allows for use, copying, modifying, merge, distributing, sublicense, and selling copies of the software. I mainly chose this license for it's simplity. In the case the someone wants to fork the website to use as a template, they can easily do so. Because it is a personal website, I don't believe anyone would want to use the website to generate any sort of revenue.
