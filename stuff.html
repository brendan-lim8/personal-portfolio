    <p>I got this laptop off of Facebook marketplace last year for $100 and it's been my daily driver for school since then. It may look like super old laptop from 2011 and you'd be right about that.
      However, I've pretty much replace everything in this laptop to make it a totally viable machine for everyday tasks. For the internals, I've upgraded from a slow HDD to a 240Gb SSD, 8Gb of ram,
    a new wifi card, internal usb port for my wireless mouse, new silent fan, reapplied thermal paste and thermal pads, and usb c modded the charging port. Externally, I've installed a new 9 cell
    battery, and swapped the crappy lcd display to a beautiful ips one. The total for all of these upgrades was around $300, including the laptop. Considering how old this laptop is, and without
  my bias to how much I love the Thinkpad design, the value isn't too bad for what it is. With Linux, </p>
